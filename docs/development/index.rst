Roadmap
-------

The best way to contribute is to use our Github issue list to look
at current wishes. The list is found here:

https://github.com/django-wiki/django-wiki/issues/

If you want to add a feature, consider writing a plugin. Please create an
issue to discuss whether your plugin idea is a core plugin
(``wiki.plugins.*``) or external plugin. If there are additions needed
to the plugin API, we can discuss that as well! A discussion is always welcome
in a Github issue.

Generally speaking, we need more **unit tests** to improve coverage, and new
features will not be accepted without tests. To add more stuff to the project
without tests wouldn't be fair to the project or your hard work. We use coverage
metrics to see that each new contribution does not significantly impact test
coverage.
